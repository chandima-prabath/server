Choose a web framework:
     There are many web frameworks available for Python, such as Django, Flask, and Pyramid.
     Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to research and choose the one that best fits your needs.

Create a dashboard module:
     You can create a new module or package to hold the dashboard code.
     This module should import and use the user_account_system.py module to authenticate users and retrieve data.

Design the dashboard:
     Decide on the layout and design of the dashboard.
     You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface.

Connect the frontend and backend:
     Use a templating engine to generate HTML pages dynamically, based on data retrieved from the backend.
     Flask uses Jinja2 as its templating engine, while Django has its own built-in templating engine.

Test and iterate:
     Test the dashboard and frontend thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and looks good.
     Make any necessary changes and continue to iterate until you are satisfied with the final product.
